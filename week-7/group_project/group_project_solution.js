Hey guys! Here is the Person 1 and Person 2 parts:
/* User Stories
1. As a user, I want the get the sum for a list of numbers.
2. As a user, I want to get the average for a list of numbers.
3. As a user, I want to find middle number in a list of numbers.
*/
/* Pseudocode
// test for sum
1. Declare a function called “sum” which has an array as its parameter.
2. Create a variable called “total” and assign number 0 as its starting value.
3. Loop through the input array and add each number to the variable “total”.
4. Return variable “total”
// test for mean
1. Declare a function called “mean” which has an array as its parameter.
2. Create a variable called “total” and assign number 0 as its starting value.
3. Loop through the input array and add each number to the variable “total”.
4. Retrieve the length of the array and have the total divided by it and then assign it into a new variable called “result”.
5. Return the “result”.
// test for median
1. Declare a function called “median” which has an array as its parameter.
2. Retrieve the length of the array.
3. Sort the array from small to large (If the array is not in order)
4. Have the length of the array plus 1 then divided by 2 to retrieve the position of the median.
5. For an odd number items array, the median should be the middle number. For an even number items array, the median should be the average of the middle 2 number.
