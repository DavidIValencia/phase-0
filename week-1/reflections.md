# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection 

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I learned about achieving a state of flow and time boxing.  Achieving a state of flow, or getting in the zone, is one is able to lose their ego and completely commit to the task at hand.  This is something that I have encountered in the past while working, but I had never read about as a visualized idea.  I did some research on flow, and learned that it has been theorized that the key to a happy lifestyle is to constantly go into a state of flow.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time boxing is setting up a predetermined amount of time to work on a project and then analyzing the work that was done after the period is over.  This is a useful tool for phase 0 as it allows you to avoid being task focused and getting stuck in a rabbit hole.  If you expect to be able to complete a task is a certain amount of time and you can't, you know that you need to rethink your approach, estimate more time for the task in the future, or seek help.

How do you manage your time currently?
While working on projects, I track my time that I spend on tasks in excel.  This is a useful strategy that I learned in the auditing world because it allows you to have a good perspective on how long things are taking, and it allows you to have a guidelines for roughly how long it should take others to complete similar tasks.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current strategy I feel is pretty effective, however there is always room for improvement in my tracking methodologies.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I plan on trying out time boxing as an addition to my current strategy as it is a concept I have not pondered before.  At other jobs, I have been much more task oriented, and I am interested in switching things up and looking at things from more of a time based perspective.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I plan to track my progress on my assignments using my tracking methodologies and will set aside chunks of 30 minutes for short assignments, 1 hour for medium assignments, 1.5 hours for medium long assignments, and 2.5 hours for long assignments.  I will also achieve a state of flow by using headphones to channel in on music and lose myself in work regularly.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell?:


a shell is a user interface that one uses to communicate with the computer

What is "bash?":


bash is the default unix shell on OSX that can be accessed by opening the Terminal


What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?:


The most challenging thing was to learn to quickly read and decipher what was going on in the command line. When I first started watching the video, I was not fully able to comprehend what was going on, but after I got to do the hands on part of the exercise the concepts from the video made a lot more sense.


Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?:


The only command I struggled with was rmdir very early on, as I was getting a message that some directories weren't empty (even though I thought they were). I ended up just using rm rf- to delete these, and didn't run into that problem again.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?:


mk and rm are incredibly important because this allows you to create and remove items. pwd, .., and pushd/popd are also great for moving around the directories and figuring out where you are

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd: stands for print working directory, and it shows you which directory you are currently in

-ls: shows you the contents of your working directory

-mv: renames the item that you execute the command on

-cd: moves your current directory (can be further down the stack or further up by using ..)

-../: stands for the directory directly up from the directory it relates to (eg. if I had x/y/z and my working directory was y, cd .. would make my working directory x)

-touch: makes an empty file

-mkdir: makes a new directory

-less: shows a text file in a page by page mode where you can navigate using the space bar and w (or the arrow keys) and quit with q

-rmdir: removes a directory

-rm: removes an object

-help: I used man in OSX, essentially this allows you to view more detail (the manual) on the commands within the shell

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
The first step would be to open one's GitHub account.  In order to create a new repo, one would go the the "+" sign at the top right of their profile and click new repository.  One would then go through the attributes that they want their repository to have in the next page and then will create the repository.  In order to fork a repository, one would go to the repository they wish to fork on GitHub and click the fork button.  Once the forking button has been clicked, one chooses the account they wish to fork the repository to, and the repository is forked to their GitHub profile.  To clone a repository, one goes to their command line and goes to the directory that they want to store the repo.  One types in "git clone" and then copies and pastes the html from the GitHub repository into the command line.  One presses enter, and the repository is cloned to their directory.  One would fork instead of create a new repository because it is far simpler to essentially copy someone else's repository instead of having to create and populate a repository from scratch.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I did not have many issues setting up either git or GitHub, but I leaned a lot about how my computer interacts with GitHub and how to effectively use git in order to clone repositories.
