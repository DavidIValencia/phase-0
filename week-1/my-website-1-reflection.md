##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

You will first need to open the website GitHub.com and go to your profile.From there, you will choose to create a repository using the buttons in the upper right hand side that looks like a plus.  Name your repository and select an MIT license.
Next you will want to create your repository by clicking the create button and you should be taken to the repository page.  Your repository will have an address labeled https: which you will copy.  Go to your command line (terminal on mac) and enter in "git clone" and then paste that url.


###Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code is avialable to developers other than the creator who can edit, distribute, and alter the code.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that open source makes me feel fine when it is used for certain applications.  It's amazing that large prjects can be socially sourced to developers who simply want to make progress on an idea.  It is also awesome that developers give people access to some of the great code that they have developed so that everyone can access it.  However, it's important that not all code is open source, otherwise code that took years to develop that is extremely costly will just be taken and given away for free.  It doesn't feel like utopia, but it's very cool that so much code is open source.

##### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are extremely important for developers so that they don't get caught up in illegally sharing or editing something and try to sell it as their own.  It is importnat to have a working knowledge of what the different licenses grant you so that you are able to distinguish what you can use and what you can't when working on a project.

###### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I got even more practice with git, which is always a good thing.  I am getting way more of a hang of the different commands, and only have to look them up once in a while now.  I also am getting it worked into my brain to always work on a new branch, which I was having some trouble with in the previous challenge.
