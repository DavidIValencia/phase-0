<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was interesting to translate it to an actual site.  I had programmed in HTML before, but I always would play around in pre-built code or use a template, so this was a great learning experience.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was very easy to do.  We just googled html5 signs for & and copyright and they were easily obtainable.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We did well at keeping best practices.  Our idents could have been a bit more organized, but besides that, we kept to the ideal format for the most part.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It is a simple language for coding and it's really easy to test by launching it in a browser.  The bad thing is that you need to use CSS on top of it, so it isn't a one stop shop when it comes to designing a website.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I remember "img src=" very well because I spent a lot of time when I was a kid adding pictures to my blog posts.  All of the language that we used in the exercise seems pretty straightforward to me, and I don't need to use many semantic tricks to figure out what is going on.
