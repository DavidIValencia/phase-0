#####What are the 6 phases of Web Design
The 6 phases of web design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance

#####What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My Site's primary purpose is to serve as a professional website.  My website will feature content having to do with what I have developed and other showcases to my professional experience.

#####What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target market is potential employers.  I see my site addressing them by clearly laying out my professional experience in a way that is easy for them to view, and also displays my skill as a developer.

#####What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action that the user should take when coming to my sight is to contact me personally through the email or phone number listed under my contact information.

#####What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The main things people should know about design and UX are that websites are designed today with a user-centric focus.  In the past, one would go to the company with a website and only trying to satisfy them.  Now, understanding the actions users take on their site and how they interact with the site is of great importance.

#####What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
UX design is the process of designing a website by putting yourself in the users shoes and then by testing how actual users use the site.  It is valuable because it gives more valuable feedback to the web developers than from people who are not actively using the website.  
For example, UX testing could show that users are not behaving in the most efficient way possible.

#####Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I didn't find any parts of the challenge too tedious, but I did find some ways to make navigating around the command line more efficient for me.
